Outer Worlds: Analyzing the Discovery and Characteristics of Exoplanets
_______________________________________________________________________


Motivation
___________

My lifelong fascination with Earth and Space Science, ignited in elementary school, has only intensified over time. Inspired by countless hours spent exploring books, movies, video games, and NASA documentaries, I've always looked to the stars with wonder. This project offers an incredible opportunity to delve deeper into astrometry data, aligning with my aspirations to contribute meaningfully to the field of space exploration.


Questions
___________

1. Which method has been most successful in detecting exoplanets?

2. How does exoplanet radius and mass vary with distance from the host star for different detection methods?

3. How does the eccentricity of an exoplanet's orbit relate to its distance from its host star?

4. What factors might explain the apparent scarcity of exoplanets with extremely short orbital periods?


Normalizing the Data
____________________

Preparing the Catalogue of Exoplanets data for analysis has involved a significant amount of cleaning and preprocessing. This included removing unnecessary columns, renaming the remaining columns to make the data easy to read and quickly reference, handling missing values, converting data to consistent units, creating new columns, addressing outliers, and filtering both the detection method and year columns for the focal points of the analysis. 


Problems and Hurdles 
____________________

Navigating the vast exoplanet dataset has presented various challenges. Visualizing complex relationships between variables and selecting appropriate statistical tests has required careful consideration. Additionally, a strong understanding of astronomical concepts has been essential to interpret results accurately. Overcoming these hurdles has been a rewarding process, allowing me to gain valuable insights into exoplanet detection methods.
