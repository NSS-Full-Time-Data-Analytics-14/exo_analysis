<h1>Outer Worlds: Analyzing the Discovery and Characteristics of Exoplanets</h1>




<h2>Inspiration</h2>

Life itself. My fascination with Earth and Space Science began in elementary school science class and has only grown stronger. I have since often looked up and wondered so many things. From books and movies to video games and NASA documentaries, this passion has been shaped by a multitude of influences. This project is a great chance for me to dive deeper into astrometry data, align with my aspirations, and move closer to my goals in meaningfully contributing to space exploration.





<h2>Questions</h2>

1. Which method has been most successful in detecting exoplanets?

2. How do the distances of stars detected by different detection methods compare?

3. How does exoplanet radius and mass vary with distance from the host star for different detection methods?

4. What factors might explain the apparent scarcity of exoplanets with extremely short orbital periods?






<h2>Normalizing the Data</h2>

Preparing the Catalogue of Exoplanets data for analysis has involved a significant amount of cleaning and preprocessing. This included removing unnecessary columns, renaming the remaining columns to make the data easy to read and quickly reference, handling missing values, converting data to consistent units, creating new columns, addressing outliers, and filtering both the detection method and year columns for the focal points of the analysis. 






<h2>Problems and Hurdles</h2>

Navigating the vast exoplanet dataset has presented various challenges. Visualizing complex relationships between variables and selecting appropriate statistical tests has required careful consideration. Additionally, a strong understanding of astronomical concepts has been essential to interpret results accurately. Overcoming these hurdles has been a rewarding process, allowing me to gain valuable insights into exoplanet detection methods.
